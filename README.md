# üöÄ smart-iot-system
This is a repo for my graduation project; a prototype of an IoT-based smart lighting and security system.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technology used:
ESP32 and written in C++ (used Arduino Library and PlatformIO in VS Code). HTML was used for the captive portal.

## The system includes:
- A piezo buzzer to alert neighbours of a possible intrusion.
- Addressable LEDs personalized based on type of user (owner or guest).
- Servo motor for door lock.
- Ultrasonic sensor to gauage distance from door or setup.
- LCD Display to show access type.
